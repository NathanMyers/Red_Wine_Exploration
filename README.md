# Project Title

This project uses R to apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple 
variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies in a sample of Red Wine Data. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to view the project, you will need to install R. You can download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

After installing R, you will need to download and install R Studio. 

Finally, you will need to install a few packages. I recommend opening R Studio and installing the following packages using the command line.


* install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = T) 
* install.packages("knitr", dependencies = T)
* install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = T)
